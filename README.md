"Fully script From SQL injection to Shell" section 6 exercise of Pentesterlab Bootcamp

This is my script for the exercise "Fully script From SQL injection to Shell" from Pentesterlab Bootcamp.

##UPDATE##
Script Recreated with Golang
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<h2>HOW TO USE:</h2>

To use the script, go to https://pentesterlab.com/exercises/from_sqli_to_shell/course and download the iso. Open the iso on Vmware or VmBox and use "ifconfig" to see its ip address.
Paste the IP address on a browser to access the vulnerable website.

Open the script and change the IP address in the url variables to the IP address of your vulnerable machine (SQLi ISO).

Python:

To use the Python script you need to have a version of Python3 installed (comes pre-installed on most Linux distributions):
```
$ python3 penlab_sqli.py
```
Note: You need to be on the same folder of the python script.

Golang:

To use the Golang script you should have Golang installed on your Operating System (loads of tutorials on how to install Go online). I will add the executable to the repository which was created on my Kali Linux (Debian) machine so it might not work on other distributions. Best option is to install Go and compile it yourself.

Note: You need to be on the same directory of the executable and script to execute it.

Run the executable:

```
$ ./sqli
```

Run the script(with Go installed):

```
$ go run sqli.go
```

Build your own executable(with Go installed:

```
$ go build sqli.go
```
After executing this command you should have the 'sqli' executable on the same directory of your script.

<h2>How it works:</h2>

The script goes through 5 steps:
  - Checking for SQLi in the website
  - If there is a possible SQLi, find the number of columns in the database
  - See which columns display the injected data
  - Pull the "users" tables from the database
  - Get admin credentials
  
<h2>Output of the script (Go version):</h2>
