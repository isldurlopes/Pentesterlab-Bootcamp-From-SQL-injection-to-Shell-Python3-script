"Fully script From SQL injection to Shell" section 6 exercise of Pentesterlab Bootcamp

This is my script for the exercise "Fully script From SQL injection to Shell" from Pentesterlab Bootcamp.

To use the script, go to https://pentesterlab.com/exercises/from_sqli_to_shell/course and download the iso. Open the iso on Vmware or VmBox and use "ifconfig" to see its ip address.
Paste the IP address on a browser to access the vulnerable website.

Open the script and change the IP address in the url sections to the IP address of the you vulnerable machine.

The script goes through 5 steps:
  - Checking for SQLi in the website
  - If there is a possible SQLi, find the number of columns in the database
  - See which columns display the injected data
  - Pull the "users" tables from the database
  - Get admin credentials
  
Output of the script:
